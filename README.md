CoreLatencyTable is a fork of CoreLatencyTest which only adds all threads to all threads tests and outputs them into a CSV table.
For example, 16 threads CPU will perform 16*16=256 tests that take about 30 minutes depending on your core latency.
The app should work with all modern CPUs and APUs and was successfully tested on Zen1, Zen2, and Coffee Lake architectures both mobile and desktop ones.
